# PROBLEM STATEMENT
According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), approximately 600 million people in Africa live without access to electricity, with rural areas being the most affected. Countries in Sub-Saharan Africa experience the most severe electricity shortages, where the electrification rate is less than 50%. This disparity is stark compared to the global average, where over 90% of the population has access to electricity.
